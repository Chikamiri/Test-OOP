*About what are the difference between each code:
    For the value return:
        +Part 1: 5 10;
        +Part 2: 20 20;
        +Part 3: 15;

    - Part 1 has nothing to discuss about, code performed from up to down.
    - Part 2 has "n1=n2", which made both "n1" and "n2" point to the same object.
    - Part 3 has Function Call f(n), which set the "i" field of "Number" object from 14 to 15.
